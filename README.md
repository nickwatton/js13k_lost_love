# js13k_lost_love
Competition entry for js13k 2017
http://js13kgames.com

A maze game.
You have to find the Love, but it's hiding in the shadows.

TODO - 
My lives display breaks in the competition environment, so will patch after the judging is done :(



This was a technical challenge to create a JavaScript game in under 13K, within a month.
Compressing the walls data for the maze screens has been fun, as has been casting dynamic shadows.

This started as an audio only game idea, but I need to get better with the audio API.
I would like to dynamically create the mazes, and even the copy.

But the biggest challenge was finding time to work on this, and those TODOs will have to wait.

I have tried to comment helpfully, and hope there might be some use in this for others.
And if nothing else, the difficulty is about right for my six year old, so I'm happy.

Enjoy.
