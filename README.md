Competition entry for js13k 2017

A maze game.
You have to find the Love, but it's hiding in the shadows.


UPDATE - 
Lives display fixed.
Added new final level: Love can be Cruel


This was a technical challenge to create a JavaScript game in under 13K, within a month.
Compressing the walls data for the maze screens has been fun, as has been casting dynamic shadows.

This started as an audio only game idea, but I need to get better with the audio API.
I would like to dynamically create the mazes, and even the copy. But that would be another game - this is all about hand crafting.

But the biggest challenge was finding time to work on this, and those TODOs will have to wait.

I have tried to comment helpfully, and hope there might be some use in this for others.
And if nothing else, the difficulty is about right for my six year old, so I'm happy.

Enjoy.
